# Translator App by me

The translator script file is self explanatory, check the file to read the JavaScript code


## Technology requirement

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript


### What I learned in the project

- I was able to translate between languages with the help of mymemory API. I fetched data from the web and integrated it in my script code (I'll attach the link to the web below)
- Swapping the selected language and text area which was a bit confusing
- In built JavaScript features such as speech utterance and text copy to clipboard are new concepts I learned
