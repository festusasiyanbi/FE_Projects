# Music Player App by me

**This music player app is one of the most challenging and interesting projects I've worked on thus far.**

## Technology requirements

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Below are concepts I found helpful while I was working on the project: 

- This project involves manipulating  array of music which is one of the major concept to learn in JavaScript as a beginner. 
- It also involves generating random background-color for the body of my document in JavaScript
- I learned how to check for previous and next object amongst the ones nested in an the music array
- Setting updates for my duration_slide required some technical mathematics operations

All these concepts I found challeneging at first as a beginner yet they're really helpful.
