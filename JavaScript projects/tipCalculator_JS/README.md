# Frontend Mentor - Tip calculator app solution

This is a solution to the [Tip calculator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tip-calculator-app-ugJNGbJUX). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

### Technologies requirements

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript


### The challenge

I was challenged to build a Tip calculator where users would be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

### The process
After styling my calculator, I moved on to implememnt the functionality part in JavaScript. The calculator basically takes 3 different inputs from user (The bill amount, the tip percentage, and the total amount to be paid per person). This is how the JavaScript code calculates the input;

It takes the value(amount) of the bill, and then multiply by the tip percentage value to give us the Tip amount value
**NB: I had to divide the tip percentage by "100" as it's in percentage**

The app then adds the amount of the bill to the tip amount to get the total amount
And it finally put into comsideration the number of people to share the bills by dividing the total amount by the number of people and displays the final result on the screen.


### Continued development
Realistically, I'm not so comfortable with API fetching, Promises, Async/Await yet so I'm considering building a quiz app next where I will be fetching questions amd answers from trivia API so as to be more conversant with the methodologies in JavaScript. Forging ahead in my journey, I'll be more than glad to share all I learn with you, stay tuned.  ðŸ“Œ
