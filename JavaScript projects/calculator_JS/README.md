# Calculator by me

## Project description

This project is essential for beginners (like me) as it includes usage of some significant  JavaScript methods like the split() method to convert strings into an array, the toString() method to convert an array into a string, the slice() method to extract a string and return a new one OR slice out an item in an array, the splice() method to insert a new element into an array at a specified position. The project also involves looping through an array, very interesting project!
